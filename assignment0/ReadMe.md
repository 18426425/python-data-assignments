Q3: I chose the first way, which is to assemble the content of all 5 files and extract keyword list for one string. And I think it is more practical, for if there are loads of files and data to be processed, it maybe pretty tough for us to combine or merge the results came out based on each file, nevertheless assemble all the files in advance is feasible. Here I find a "os" module on the internet, by using which I am able to find the path and read the whole files in a certain folder.
