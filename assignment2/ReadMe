Originally, I wanted to do the data-collection over again, for I found that, based on the data I gained in assignment1, it hard for me to selected three news story angles.
I tried to slice the 2nd element,however, somehow it turned out a csv file with only header but no content. I tried many times, but failed all the time.
So I used the data I gained before and did this not good visualisation assignment.==
